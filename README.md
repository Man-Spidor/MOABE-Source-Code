The Souce Code for the MOABE Game Engine library.

**MOTHER. OF. ALL. BROKEN. ENGINES.**

**SET UP**

1.) Download this project, run and build it, this will give you the library files.

2.) Create a new project in Visual Studio and copy the project settings files from this project.

3.) Place the library files and all the header files in this project into a folder somewhere.

4.) Include the header files in the new project, add the library to the new project and you should be ready to go.



**To Use The Library** 

To start a project using this library, you must create an extended **Scene** class of your own, and an extended version of the **MOABEUserFunctions**. In the overwritten user functions, you must specify the start scene as well as load any assets you will need. Finally, you will need to either create a camera of your own and set it as the main camera using the **SceneManager**. Now you are ready to start your very first MOABE project!
